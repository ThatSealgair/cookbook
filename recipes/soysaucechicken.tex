\begin{recipe}{Soy Sauce Chicken}{Serves 5}{30min}
\Ing{800g chicken nibbles}
\Ing{salt}
Step 1
Place chicken nibbles in a tupperware container, as you do, season liberally with salt. Toss chicken to ensure all pieces have salt on them. Seal and place chicken to marinate in fridge for 3 hours or overnight.

Note: For quantity of salt, I generally eyeball it at about 1 - 2 pinches of salt per chicken nibble piece.

\Ing{1 tbsp Neutral oil}
Step 2
Pour oil into a sauce pan and heat on medium-high heat. Place chicken nibbles in pan so that each piece is touching the hot plate of the pan. Place a lid on the pan and let the nibbles sear until the skin is a little brown. Flip the nibbles and repeat until skin is brown on the other side.

\Ing{1 tsp crushed garlic}
\Ing{1 tsp crushed ginger}
\Int{3 tbsp soy sauce}
Step 3
Add ginger and garlic to the pan and fry until aromatic (about 1 minute). Add soy sauce to pan and stir through chicken nibbles. Cover and simmer on medium-low heat for about 10min or until sauce is thick enough to coat chicken nibbles.

Note: This recipe, as traditional, is mostly just estimations and 'that looks about alright' to guide the recipe so follow your heart.
